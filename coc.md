## Chadev Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the community. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk.

## The Quick Version

Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from events without a refund at the discretion of the event organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Chadev leadership. See help email above.

Community leaders will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the events. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at community events and workshop venues and community-related social events.
